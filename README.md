## Quick Start
To Use my latex resume source templates, 5 steps to go:
1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/igoingdown/MyResume.git`. 
1. change to a latex source file dir, like: `cd Job_zh`. 
1. change latex file as well as the photo file
1. use `xelatex` to compile `main.tex`: `xelatex main.tex`
1. if no bugs in latex source file, you will get a resume named `main.pdf`. Congratulations!
